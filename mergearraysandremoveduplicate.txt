You are tasked with implementing a utility function mergeArrays that takes two sorted arrays of numbers and merges them into a single sorted array without duplicates.
Write a function mergeArrays with the following signature:
typescript
Copy code
function mergeArrays(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): number[];
Requirements:
Both input arrays are sorted in ascending order.
The output array should also be sorted in ascending order.
The output array should not contain any duplicates.
Do not use the Set object to handle duplicates.
Example Input:
const array1 = [1, 3, 5, 7];
const array2 = [2, 3, 6, 8, 9];
const result = mergeArrays(array1, array2);
Expected Output:
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
